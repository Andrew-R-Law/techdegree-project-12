 The 12th Project for TeamTreeHouse's Web Development TechDegree.

 To start the app, open the terminal and enter "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies.

 Then enter "npm start" in the terminal. The app will be listening on localhost:5000.

Much of the code here is inspired by Guil Hernandez's code in several Team TreeHouse courses, most notably those from Team TreeHouses's 12th unit in the Web Development Degree.
